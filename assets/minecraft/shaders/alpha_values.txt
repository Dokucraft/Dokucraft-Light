Special alpha values to use in textures to enable certain shader effects:

The shaders that the values apply to are in square brackets.

 18: Medium wave effect (transparent) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
 19: Strong wave effect (transparent) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
 20: Weak wave effect (transparent) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
 22: Delayed weak wave effect (transparent) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
 24: Lantern swing (transparent) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
 26: Note particle [particle]
141: Lantern swing (opaque) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
211: Grass effect (low-poly/dense) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
212: Grass effect (low-poly) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
247: Better lava [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
248: Parallax subsurface [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
252: Strong wave effect (opaque) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
253: Medium wave effect (opaque) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
254: Weak wave effect (opaque) [solid, cutout, mipped cutout]
