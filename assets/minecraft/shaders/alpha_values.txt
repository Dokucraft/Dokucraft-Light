Special alpha values to use in textures to enable certain shader effects:

The shaders that the values apply to are in square brackets.

 19: Strong wave effect (transparent) [terrain]
 20: Weak wave effect (transparent) [terrain]
 22: Delayed weak wave effect (transparent) [terrain]
 24: Lantern swing (transparent) [terrain]
 25: Disable tint (transparent) [particle]
141: Lantern swing (opaque) [terrain]
211: Grass effect (low-poly/dense) [terrain]
212: Grass effect (low-poly) [terrain]
247: Better lava [terrain]
248: Parallax subsurface [terrain]
249: Emissive (maps to 190 alpha) [entity, terrain]
