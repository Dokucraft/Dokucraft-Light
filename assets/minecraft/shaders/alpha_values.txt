Special alpha values to use in textures to enable certain shader effects:

The shaders that the values apply to are in square brackets.

 18: Medium wave effect (transparent) [terrain_cutout]
 19: Strong wave effect (transparent) [terrain_cutout]
 20: Weak wave effect (transparent) [terrain_cutout]
 22: Delayed weak wave effect (transparent) [terrain_cutout]
 24: Lantern swing (transparent) [terrain_cutout]
 25: Disable tint (transparent) [particle]
141: Lantern swing (opaque) [terrain_cutout]
211: Grass effect (low-poly/dense) [terrain_cutout]
212: Grass effect (low-poly) [terrain_cutout]
247: Better lava [terrain_cutout]
248: Parallax subsurface [terrain_cutout]
249: Emissive (maps to 190 alpha) [entity, terrain_cutout]
250: Emissive (maps to 255 alpha) [entity, terrain_cutout]
252: Strong wave effect (opaque) [terrain_cutout]
253: Medium wave effect (opaque) [terrain_cutout]
254: Weak wave effect (opaque) [terrain_cutout]
